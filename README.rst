Warning: Documentation-driven development. Not yet released.

``Unzipit`` will look at the type of file you're trying to unzip and pass the correct args to `tar` and `unzip` for you, piping thing when needed. I can simply never remember them when I need. 

Usage

Strait forward, really. ::

    $ unzipit <filename>


Installation
============

::

    $ pip install unzipit
