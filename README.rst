Unzipper
--------

Warning: Documentation-driven development. Not yet released.

Unzipper will look at the type of file you're trying to unzip and pass the correct args to `tar` and (maybe) others for you. I can simply never remember them when I need. 

Usage
-----

Strait forward, really. ::

    $ unzipper <filename>


Installation
============

::

    $ pip install unzipper
